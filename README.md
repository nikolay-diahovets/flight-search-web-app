# Flight search web-app

This is a test task project where is created flight search web-app using React.

## Task description

Your task is to build a flight search web-app.
- Three pages - home, results, checkout.
- Home page should have a standard flight search form.
- Results page should list flights that come back from the flight search API we provide - display whatever info you see fit. User should also be able to sort/filter/paginate the results (see flight API doc below to see what’s possible to filter/sort by, and how to paginate).
- Checkout page should have a standard travel checkout form and display the selected flight.
- Please use this flight search API to search for flights and display them: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mW7VDujSHYzB6C5lP_lXG4zX8_Rm-VFxwGtxaSbpiXo/edit?usp=sharing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
